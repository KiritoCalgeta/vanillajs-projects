    // In order to tell if a number is prime or not using JS, first you must put in a function to check if the number is less than 2.
    // Both 0 and 1 cannot be prime numbers.
    // next, you assign i = 2, and then loop a number from itself, to its squareroot. This will check if the number is divisible by any number between the original and the square.
    // Then, return false if it is, return true if it isn't.
    //Then print the conditions to the console.
